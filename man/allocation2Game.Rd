\title{Converts an allocation to its associated additive game}
\usage{
allocation2Game(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector representing an allocation (payoff for each player).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length \eqn{2^n - 1} representing the additive game associated with \code{x}.
}
\description{
Given an allocation vector \eqn{x \in \mathbb{R}^n}, this function constructs
the additive game \eqn{v} such that \eqn{v(S) = \sum_{i \in S} x_i} for all coalitions \eqn{S}.
}
\examples{
x <- c(0.1, 0.4, 0.5)
v <- allocation2Game(x)
print(v)
